	<p>
		Six Data Types that are primitives, checked by typeof operator: <br />
		undefined : typeof instance === "undefined" <br />
		Boolean : typeof instance === "boolean" <br />
		Number : typeof instance === "number" <br />
		String : typeof instance === "string" <br />
		BigInt : typeof instance === "bigint" <br />
		Symbol : typeof instance === "symbol" <br />
	</p>
	

	<p>null : typeof instance === "object". <br />
		Special primitive type having additional usage for it's value: if object is not inherited, then null is shown;
	</p>

	<p>Object : typeof instance === "object". <br />
	 	Special non-data but structural type for any constructed object instance also used as data structures: new Object, new Array, new Map, new Set, new WeakMap, new WeakSet, new Date and almost everything made with new keyword;</p>

	<p>
		Function non data structure, though it also answers for typeof operator:<br /> 
		typeof instance === "function". This answer is done as a special shorthand for Functions, though every Function constructor is derived from Object constructor.

		let a = false;
		let b = 'apple';
		let c = 10;
		let d = function() {
			console.log("it is a function");
		}
		let e = {name: "amit", phone: "9716513349"}

		console.log(typeof a);
		console.log(typeof b);
		console.log(typeof c);
		console.log(typeof d);
		console.log(typeof e);
